The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time. \n\nFor manual installations, select the \"Encrypt\" checkbox during partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time the system boots. \n\nFor automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding the \"--encrypted\" and \"--passphrase=\" options to the definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition: \n\npart / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=[PASSPHRASE]\n\nAny [PASSPHRASE] is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the \"--passphrase=\" option from the partition definition will cause the installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation. \n\nDetailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on the Red Had Documentation web site:\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-LUKS_Disk_Encryption.html",
